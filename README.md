Duplicate-Photo-MultiPacks

Helps you quickly generate "multi-pack" images from a single product photo. Instead of unpacking and arranging multiple items for a new photo, this tool duplicates the original image to create 5-pack, 10-pack, and other bundled visuals.

Features
photo.py: Processes a single product image and generates a multi-pack version.

multiplephotos.py: Batch processes all images in a folder, applying the same multi-pack effect to each.

Use Case
Ideal for e-commerce sellers or marketers who want to showcase bulk item listings without extra photography.
